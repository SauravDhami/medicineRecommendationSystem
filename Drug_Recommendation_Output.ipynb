My acne, like others, was horrible before Accutane. Another thing to note, I had virtually zero side-effects, just a little bit of dryness around my mouth and lips.

Just brush your lips with a toothbrush in the morning and at night and put some aquaphor/lip balm on after and you&#039;ll be fine for the whole day.

Grades were never a problem, but behavior and socialization were. She hated the medication and would spit it out or hide it. It gave her headaches, loss of appetite and sleep loss. Eventually she began taking it regularly and began to do well in school. The behavior problems ceased as well as socialization. She took this medication for about 2 years and then I decided to pull her off.

Fast forward five years later.  I just had that one removed and my second one put in.  No pain for the removal, just a slight pinch.  Much easier time getting the second one.  Again, only spotted and slight cramping for one day.   For the five years that I had the first one, I only spotted periodically.  Nothing more.

I started falling and staying asleep for a good 8 hours, my ruminating has stopped almost completely, and my depression has really lifted.

       " 'I was initially prescribed 200mg daily (100mg morning and night) along with 10mg of Citalopram (which I&#039;ve been on for a while). I have had generalized anxiety disorder for 7 years and was never prescribed anything but Prozax (when I was 15, and I had a bad reaction and was taken off it) and citalopram). I begged my doctor for an anti-anxiety medication as I was really desperate. I was afraid of taking a new medicine too, but took it anyway. I can honestly say it is incredible. My sometimes near constant anxiety state went down to near nothing. After about 3 months I needed to go up to 150mg twice daily. After about another 2 1/2 months some anxiety and sleep problems have crept back and I think that I may need another increase. My only problem with this frankly amazing medicine is its tendency to wear off after a few months. I experienced few side effects (dizziness, fatigue, loss of appetite). I have recommended this to a friend.',\n",

His diet was exceptional, eating vegetables, fish, fruit, rice, and no sugary drinks or high fructose corn syrup.  Lots of love and discipline at home. Got in trouble all the time at home and school because he&#039;s uncontrollable.\\r\\nWith Focalin he immediately improved and is doing great in school.  He is actually happier and feeling better now.  While his appetite is down while on the medicine (about 7 hours), he eats a huge breakfast and a huge dinner to compensate.  Even his tick has gone away.   We are very relieved. Only downside is that it only lasts about 7 hours.  So when he gets home, he starts amping up again.',\n",

I have tried almost everything else in the military medical inventory to win against the URI&#039;s I get yearly (every Sept/Oct Time frame) but Zithromax wins hands down every time.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes not matter during which stage of the URI you begin to take the medicine.  The first or second night you will start to fight the infection hardcore and you might notice a fever develop as your body fights against the bacteria.  After that its smooth sailing so you feel better by the 3rd day and completely cured by the 5th day.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is definitely a wonder drug and worth the extra money.',\n",

But I stuck it out and by the third month everything was back to normal and I haven&#039;t had a period since. I super enjoy that. My sex drive was normal and it was a relief not to make constant trips to the doc for condoms anymore specially since I&#039;ve been with the same partner for over 5 years. The insertion was very easy and fast with minimal scaring. My insurance covered both the device and the visit to have it inserted. So far I will never go back to any other birth control.
