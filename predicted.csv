63669,epiduo,acne,it works! gave it a  /   because while it gets rid of most acne  you can find a small pimple or two every once in a while. most of the people complaining that it doesn      t work have only been taking the product for a month or less  and for it to really work you need to give   months. it gives an initial       acne-fighting       power  then i broke out again  and then by the   month mark my face was perfect. great medicine  highly recommended.,9,30,1.2,8.133188531216907,8

99922,magnesium sulfate   potassium sulfate   sodium sulfate,bowel preparation,"as an anxious first-timer who scoured the web for answers to my many concerns  i found this thread most helpful. so  here are my two-cents.

suprep is very effective. got a  quot gold star quot  from my gi for  quot cleanliness quot .

with cold water  a straw and a green apple jolly rancher chaser between sips  the taste was not as bad as i thought it would be. (it      s definitely not good!) first dose (  pm) went down in  -  sips. second dose ( :   am) took more time and patience  like    much smaller sips to avoid gagging. (not sure why the difference.)

followed instructions to the letter. only got an hour or so of sleep overnight  so i rather enjoyed my  quot nap quot  during the procedure. very relieved to know all is well  and all my worry was for nothing.

37456,vyvanse,adhd,vyvanse is great.  it has a longer dosing window than adderall xr (   vs   hours for me) and a slightly improved side-effect profile.  as a longtime (~   years) prescription stimulant user  for adhd  i would recommend vyvanse to any user that is currently unsatisfied with their adhd management.  it is no silver bullet  but there are no silver bullets for adhd.  it is incremental innovation in a great way. vyvanse is the first real stimulant to reduce side effects without cutting efficacy.,9,29,5.0,8.116519079894156,8
211845,lamotrigine,bipolar disorde,"very effective but the side effect are bad if i don      t take it correctly. i think there are ways you can reduce the effects( getting correct dosage of course)

do you take them food?i take them with food  i defiantly feel side effect  every time if i don      t eat properly and skiip a meal
are you on any hormone treatment hrt/pill? i have found that there is a  as i call it  lower absorption rate as i      m on hrt and my consultant phy agrees  so i am taking a high does.what dosage?

in regards to side effects  they were very strong for me.  i had nausea  blurry vision and dizziness but learned to control it with protein.  i cannot express how much protein has helped me!  it has replaced my breakfast and i drink it along with coffee and grapefruit oil infused water.  i no longer crave or worry about food like before ",9,24,1.29,8.022531747968001,8

207951,suprep bowel prep kit,bowel preparation,as a general rule i don      t like liquid medicines  however i did find a few tricks i have read on the internet worked quite well for me and maybe for some other people with issues.  i found that putting the prep bottles in the fridge for about   -   hours before use so as to make the solution as cold as possible makes it taste less like medicine.  i also found that reconstituting the suprep with ginger ale instead of tap water helps to get the prep down much easier.  also use a straw so that you can shoot the medicine as far back in your throat as possible to avoid as much as possible certainly helps.,9,24,1.17,8.022531747968001,8

153425,doxycycline,acne,i never really had acne until my senior year in high school. i always washed my face before i went to bed  and i tried about every type of face wash you can think of. it took me a year to go to the dermatologist just because when my acne seemed to be getting bad it would clear up again. i never had cystic acne  but i still felt uncomfortable with my skin. i finally decided to go to a dermatologist  and i      m so thankful i did. i      ve been on this medicine for almost a month  and my skin is just so much better. the doctor put me on the     mg medicine for a total of   months   amp  i also use tretinoin cream a few times a week. cetaphil face wash  and aveeno moisturizer are also things i use on the daily to keep my skin clean and from drying out.,9,42,1.2,8.293215263915325,8
13412,amphetamine   dextroamphetamine,narcolepsy,i thought nuvigil was good  but adderall is amazing.  it helps me feel almost human  again.  not only does adderall keep me awake  but it clears up some of the mental fog caused by narcolepsy.  cataplexy is also not as severe when i      m on adderall.  i can finally focus at work  i have enough energy to take care of myself and my family  and i      m doing so well at work that i got two raises in the last   months!  the irony is that you have to be well-rested for it to work  otherwise  it does absolutely nothing.  i have also started devoloping a tolerance so it starts to wear off after about  -  hours  but i take another dose and it gets me through the rest of the day.,9,42,2.25,8.293215263915325,8
59214,roxicet,pain,i was prescribed roxicet  -    for pain relief after major abdominal surgery and i have to say this was amazing! i      ve never had such complete relief from any medication before.  one tablet every   to   hours kept me completely comfortable. it made me a little sleepy  but that was fine given that i was recuperating from surgery.  it would probably not be suitable for me to take while working.  the only real side effect i experienced was a little nausea  which i learned to minimize by taking it with food.  overall  the most effective pain medication i      ve ever used.,9,43,1.75,8.30392412355297,8

132242,ativan,anxiety,an excellent medication  out of all meds i tried none were as effective for managing my ptsd symptoms. completely prevented flashbacks and nightmares and anxiety at night and allowed me to fall asleep very calmly. however i can      t give it a    because i gained tolerance to the doses incredibly quickly  meaning i had to keep raising the dose to get the same effect  which is dangerous because it is a drug you can become physically addicted to. i would highly recommend this med to those seeking a short term fix while they are becoming stable on another long term med  but would not recommend it as a long term fix due to tolerance and addiction possibilities.,9,43,1.0,8.30392412355297,8

started on   mgs mirtazipine the other day and two things hit me straight away..... food and serenity.
will keep it going as am sure the initial       hit       will subside and i      ll rejoin my body sometime but certainly if the libido matches the serenity then       hello baby!      ",9,38,1.5,8.246868723844198,8

i      ve seen some people who don      t seem to respond to the medicine  which is unfortunate. however  some advice i have. if you take this medicine with an optimistic attitude  and you      re conscience about what you      re doing (eating habits)  then i think most of the time  you      ll be successful. it      s not a miracle drug that just melts the weight off. you have to put forth the effort to listen to your mind more and not just your want to eat.

145953,suboxone,opiate dependence,suboxone are opiate-based meds  a substitute for heroine and other opioids  and therefore addictive. besides helping with withdrawal  it also made the cravings go away. like this you can put some distance between your addiction years and your new  clean life. getting off suboxone is also not easy  but nothing compared to heroine-kicking. doctors are supposed to help you lower your dosage. in the end i took a quarter of a  mg/ . mg pill every day  until one day i felt like not taking it anymore. there is no wonder cure for opiate addiction (duh!)  there will always be pain and discomfort  the only thing you can try is to minimize that! after   years of heroine and  .  years on suboxone  i finally managed to get off. i definitely recommend it!,10,26,2.75,8.593040656214207,8
202468,lithium,bipolar disorde,lithium provides a ton of stability for ultra-rapid cyclers.  the drawbacks are it interacts with almost everything in certain ways and it is fairly hard on the liver.  my primary care physician and psychiatrist work together to try to provide options that won      t affect my liver as much as a result.  because of the amount of stability it provides  i don      t think i      ll ever be able to go off of it.  i may be able to lower it by trying changes to other things.  but it just works too well at giving stability.  i don      t like when the pharmacist says it out loud because it      s a dead giveaway of what you      re taking it for.  ,10,26,1.8,8.593040656214207,8

64003,sertraline,social anxiety disorde,"i have dealt with ups and downs  anxiety  social anxiety  depression etc. etc. for years.  my life overall is normal and i managed the episodes but i always knew they were there and didn      t like feeling that way. i am married we have children combine that with everything else and it times it was just too much. the doctor suggested the zoloft.  i was nervous at first and really didn      t know what to expect. in fact i waited a month or two to even fill the prescription. the side effects  we      re obvious at first. dizziness  tired  minor confusion. i don      t want to scare anyone because i still functioned   still was able to work  i was able to take care of the kids   everything was pretty much normal but i could tell my mind was a bit off.     
after about a month the side effects faded away from me. after two months my mind became clear and my attitude towards life improved dramatically. little things didn      t bother me anymore. i started working out and that didn      t bother me anymore. my wife would argue with me about normal marriage stuff but i wouldn      t yell back. in fact i was able to see how foolish most of the fighting was and how pointless it was to yell back. my work life improved. my conversations with other people improved. i found myself more interested in what the person was saying and focusing more on what they were saying.
at a follow up visit with my doctor he asked if i      d like to stay on the medication. i told him that my life has never been better and my mind never more clear so why would i choose to stop. he agreed and was happy with my progress. he initially prescribed     mg but i found    works well for me at this point. so every night before bed i take my pill and wake up the next morning feeling ready to go instead of wanting to stay in bed. 
for those just starting or thinking about starting this medication i can honestly tell you it has changed my life for the better. initially it was rough but after a while all that fades and your left feeling really good. for me it took about two months for others it may take longer or shorter.  
i hopes this helps as i read a lot about this medication prior to starting and found a lot of the write ups were negative. i honestly think those people may have other issues or conditions that this medication can      t help or they may have not been able to get through the initial break in period.",9,118,1.0,8.674177249322668,8

157099,differin,acne,"i have been using this product since it was made available without a prescription. 

if you are going to use it  be sure to read the instructions and warnings. 

this product has a period of time at the beginning of use that makes your acne worse and then clears it. i went through this process when i started taking spironolactone  so i knew what to expect and i trusted that it would go away - it did. 

my skin looks and feels fantastic! i still get an occasional zit here at there - i      m pretty sure it      s my fault as i      m a toucher/picker/popper. 

this is an easy product to add to your routine. make sure to use it at night and wash off in the morning so you don      t have to worry about sunburns. 

i highly recommend differin.",8,24,1.25,7.511893450095661,7

27050,ultram,ibromyalgia,hi  i just thought that i      d add this comment for you. i have recently been diagnosed with fibromyalgia  hepatitis  and lupus. but before my diagnoses  with no insurance  i went to the hospital when i couldn      t take the pain anymore and was prescribed ultram   mg  x a day. at first i took   and then another and so on until i reached six in a   hour period. when it finally started working it hit me like a ton of bricks. needless to say i was pain free. so my advise is start with   and wait  it just not an instant relief like codeine. unfortunately your body does become immune to its effects within abut   months. now i am taking   roxicodone a day and also adjusting to that quickly too. good luck to all of you.,7,46,1.5,7.0008549587608115,6

121107,venlafaxine,generalized anxiety disorde,"if my comment helps anyone not to take this drug effexor then i will have helped many people. i have been on and off effexor for    years i      m currently off effexor i weaned myself over   months. i have not read any where and i have done a lot of research that anyone has written if they have successfully stayed of this drug for more than    months. so hear i am to tell you it      s been   months and once the side effect of the brain buzzes nauseous aching bones itchiness have gone away
life does begin to feel better i caught myself laughing and not feeling it was fake and crying at tv shows effexor gives you a fake feeling of happiness/sadness but after being on it for to long you just feel numb i believe this is why people end up wanting to come off it cause you have no emotion that and the amount of weight you will gain.   months and i      m probably back to where i began in needing this medication but i am trying everything i possibly can to stay of it 
this includes:
free hypnosis apps
